0.9-3

-   fixed use of weights in cv.GAMBoost 
-   added flexible p value cutoff for prediction and calculation of prediction error
    in cv.GAMBoost

0.9-2

-   fixed a problem where predict.GAMBoost would not work with only linear predictors
    (thanks to Ravi Varadhan for pointing this out)
-   implemented penalty of difference '0' as absolute penalty on coefficients
-   'pdiff, specifying the penalty difference can be a vector now, thus allowing for enforcement 
    of several types of smoothness simultanoeusly'
-   fixed bug that prevented criterion from being save for AIC-optimGAMBoostPenalty
-   optimGAMBoostPenalty now also stores the selection criterion in the GAMBoost object returned
